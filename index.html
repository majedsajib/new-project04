                Abstract: Bangladesh is a disaster prone country. Every year many tropical cyclone hits the south coast. Gabura is a coastal union of Shymnagar upazila which is situated in Satkhira district. Cyclones like Aila (2009) and Sidr (2007) hit the area in past and the devastation of those cyclones was so high. Vulnerability assessment is a process of assessing physical, social and motivational vulnerability of a community. Old people are the asset of the nation. They are in highly vulnerable situation in disaster especially like cyclone. Due to less physical strength and mental capacity as well as negative approaches make them more vulnerable in the cyclonic situation. The aim of the study was to identify the vulnerability of aging people due to cyclone, find out the present coping mechanism and suggest some possible mitigation measure. Different methods and techniques like questionnaire survey, focus group discussion, case study and observation etc. were used for data collection from primary sources while statistical database, journal, published and unpublished thesis; internet etc. were used for secondary data collection. It is clear that old people are highly vulnerable situation and need to increase social awareness some specific policy making to reduce their vulnerability.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p id="Myhd">Globally, approximately 700 million people or 10 per cent of the world’s population is already over the age of 60, and by 2030, there will be more people over 60 than under 10 (UNISDR, 2015). Disasters, whether natural or anthropogenic, are sudden adverse unfortunate extreme events or hazards which cause great damage to human beings as well as plants and animals (Singh, 2008). Natural disasters are a growing threat to human populations, particularly to vulnerable groups such as the elderly (Ngo, 2001). 
            The elderly are commonly accepted as being vulnerable to natural hazards. Although the normative changes associated with aging might not apply to all members of this population, the elderly are generally at greater risk and more likely to be harmed throughout all stages of a disaster (Morrow, 1999). In disasters, older persons face accumulated tangible losses, such as the loss of loved ones and property. They also experience ambiguous losses, such as the loss of culture, friends, & a life they once knew (Rahman, 2010). They also are more likely to have multiple health problems. Older adults may struggle with moving around. Many do not have enough financial resources. They may have a small social network of friends and relatives (Gibson, 2006). These and other reasons may hurt their ability to protect them¬selves when a disaster strikes. Consequently, older adults are more vulnerable in the face of a disaster (Gibson, 2006; Jenkins, Laska, & Williamson, 2007).

            Bangladesh is located on the Bay of Bengal in the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers. The impacts of climate change are visible in the form of erratic rainfalls, increased number of intensified floods, cyclones, droughts and prevalence of rough weather in the Bay (GoB, 2010). The southern region of the country along the Bay of Bengal is prone to severe tropical storms known as cyclone, which develop over warm tropical oceans and are characterized by sustained winds of 64 knots (32.92 meters per second) or more (MoEF 2008). The cyclones tend to surge higher than in neighboring countries because the Bay narrows towards the north, where Bangladesh is located (Kabir, 2013). Tropical cyclones and storm have devastating impacts on the life and livelihood of the coastal habitants. From 1990 to 2007, Bangladesh faced several deadly cyclones, causing death of 150,000 people and displacing millions (Climate Change Cell, 2007). Although there is hitherto no rigorous scientific evidence that tropical storms in the Bay of Bengal are increasing in frequency or intensity, the coastal people perceive an increased number of cyclones over the past few years (Rahman, 2010). For instance, Super Cyclone Sidr hit on 15 November 2007, Cyclone Nargis on 2 May 2008 hit Myanmar but had less impact on Bangladesh, Cyclone Rashmi occurred on 27 October 2008, and Cyclone Aila hit on 26 May 2009. On average, a severe cyclone hit Bangladesh every three years (MoEF, 2008; Rahman M. 2008).

            <p> <hr>Physical Vulnerability: Physical Vulnerability may be determined by aspects such as population density levels, remoteness of a settlement, the site, design and materials used for critical infrastructure and for housing (UNISDR, 2015). Example: Wooden homes are less likely to collapse in an earthquake, but are more vulnerable to fire.

                <hr>Social Vulnerability: Social Vulnerability refers to the inability of people, organizations and societies to withstand adverse impacts to hazards due to characteristics inherent in social interactions, institutions and systems of cultural values. It is linked to the level of wellbeing of individuals, communities and society. It includes aspects related to levels of literacy and education, the existence of peace and security, access to basic human rights, systems of good governance, social equity, positive traditional values, customs and ideological beliefs and overall collective organizational systems (UNISDR, 2015). Example: When flooding occurs some citizens, such as children, elderly and differently-able, may be unable to protect themselves or evacuate if necessary.
                
                <hr>Cultural Vulnerability: This types of vulnerability refers to the different believes and practices people were influenced during cyclone. For instance, people think a woman can’t leave the house without the permission of husband during cyclone though he is present or not.
